Laravel 5 Framework

This laravel used for my learning blog. Sharing knowledge for other software engineer.

How to run : 
1. Open terminal
2. in your laravel directory, type command "./vendor/bin/phpunit"
3. I think everyhing already passed :)
4. You can check every test in directory ./tests

What sytanx i used in this test,
1. Custom function to check array (Box.php)
2. assertTrue, assertFalse, assertEquals, assertNull, assertCount, assertContains, assertEmpty, see, dontsee, visit

Im fighting to test using another syantax test. Should be update on my personal blog, coming soon. :)

Keep sharing, happy coding!
